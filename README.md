# CDL_hyper
This is the implementation of the paper "Collaborative Deep Learning for Recommender Systems". 
Compared to the original code, I added the recall indicator. In addition, I added Hyperopt to automatically select the optimal hyperparameter.

Python (Tensorflow) Implementation

Dataset : politic_old and politic_new (legislative roll-call dataset)

politic_old : made by Yupeng Gu (Gu, Y., Sun, Y., Jiang, N., Wang, B., & Chen, T. (2014, August). Topic-factorized ideal point estimation model for legislative voting network. In Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining (pp. 183-192). ACM.) 1990~2013 legislative rollcall dataset (THOMAS)

politic_new : made by Kyungwoo Song (under the review paper) 1990~2016 legislative rollcall dataset (from Govtrack.com)
